Mycroft skill focused on playing music from Spotify on Sonos speakers

## About
**Still very WIP** 

Requires a working instance of https://github.com/jishi/node-sonos-http-api/ running on the same host than Mycroft.

## Examples
* "Play some music"
* "Stop the music"
* "Play the playlist P"
* "Play the album A"


TODO
* "Next song"
* "Previous song"
* "Play some music by Z"
* "What is this song?"
* "... on speaker S"
* "Sonos volume up/down"

## Credits
